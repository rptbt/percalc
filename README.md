Python curses window for evaluating strings. Very rough, not secure (will execute arbitrary code). No nice features like parentheses linting yet. Please ensure terminal is at least 80 characters wide.
runme.py matches console.py but eventually console.py will include support so percalc can be installed into a virtualenv with an entry point of 'percalc'

To run: python ./percalc/runme.py
